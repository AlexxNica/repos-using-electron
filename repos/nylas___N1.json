      "message": "fix(drafts): Various improvements and fixes to drafts, draft state management\n\nSummary:\nThis diff contains a few major changes:\n\n1. Scribe is no longer used for the text editor. It's just a plain contenteditable region. The toolbar items (bold, italic, underline) still work. Scribe was causing React inconcistency issues in the following scenario:\n   - View thread with draft, edit draft\n   - Move to another thread\n   - Move back to thread with draft\n   - Move to another thread. Notice that one or more messages from thread with draft are still there.\n\nThere may be a way to fix this, but I tried for hours and there are Github Issues open on it's repository asking for React compatibility, so it may be fixed soon. For now contenteditable is working great.\n\n2. Action.saveDraft() is no longer debounced in the DraftStore. Instead, firing that action causes the save to happen immediately, and the DraftStoreProxy has a new \"DraftChangeSet\" class which is responsbile for batching saves as the user interacts with the ComposerView. There are a couple big wins here:\n\n   - In the future, we may want to be able to call Action.saveDraft() in other situations and it should behave like a normal action. We may also want to expose the DraftStoreProxy as an easy way of backing interactive draft UI.\n\n   - Previously, when you added a contact to To/CC/BCC, this happened:\n\n     <input> -> Action.saveDraft -> (delay!!) -> Database -> DraftStore -> DraftStoreProxy -> View Updates\n\nIncreasing the delay to something reasonable like 200msec meant there was 200msec of lag before you saw the new view state.\n\nTo fix this, I created a new class called DraftChangeSet which is responsible for accumulating changes as they're made and firing Action.saveDraft. \"Adding\" a change to the change set also causes the Draft provided by the DraftStoreProxy to change immediately (the changes are a temporary layer on top of the database object). This means no delay while changes are being applied. There's a better explanation in the source!\n\nThis diff includes a few minor fixes as well:\n\n1. Draft.state is gone—use Message.object = draft instead\n2. String model attributes should never be null\n3. Pre-send checks that can cancel draft send\n4. Put the entire curl history and task queue into feedback reports\n5. Cache localIds for extra speed\n6. Move us up to latest React\n\nTest Plan: No new tests - once we lock down this new design I'll write tests for the DraftChangeSet\n\nReviewers: evan\n\nReviewed By: evan\n\nDifferential Revision: https://review.inboxapp.com/D1125",

Attachment items will now also display a thumbnail preview\n    for the file when available.\n- Fixes:\n  - N1 no longer freezes when submitting a search in the search bar. (#3001)\n  - Escape key now correctly clears the current search value.\n  - Thread windows now correctly hide deleted messages depending on which\n    view you opened them from (e.g. hide deleted messages when opened from the\n    inbox, but not when opened from the trash folder).\n  - Several message height display issues have been fixed.\n  - In preferences, N1 will now only scroll to the top when switching tabs.\n  - Allow in-app notifications to be dismissable.\n  - Ensure that a send message request succeeds only once.\n  - Ensure that the latest state of our TaskQueue is saved before closing N1.\n  - Improved quoted text detection for trailing signatures.\n- Design:\n  - Design for in-app notifications has been cleaned up.\n  - Theme-picker styles have been fixed.\n- Development:\n  - A lot more code has been converted from Coffeescript to Javascript,\n    including all remaining database `Model` classes.\n  - We've re-enabled running N1 tests from within N1.\n  - We've made several improvements to the build process.\n  - Completely removed the deprecated Popover component.\n  - Removed `grim` package, which was completely unused.\n  - `TokenizingTextField` from the component-kit now supports a new prop: `onEditMotion`.\n"

You'll see a new button to enable sharing in the top toolbar.\n  - Inline images: You can now add inline images to your messages! Just\n    drag and drop or paste them anywhere in the composer.\n  - Channels: A new option in Preferences > General allows you to join our public\n    `beta` channel and receive pre-release versions of N1.\n  - Messages: Participants inside a message now have a right-click context menu\n    to copy the email address or send an email to the participant.\n- Fixes:\n  - Search now correctly displays results returned from your email provider (#750).\n  - Local / offline search now matches subject lines more loosely.\n  - Mail Merge now correctly handles empty column names.\n  - Mail Merge is now limited to 150 recipients, since 500 recipients caused many\n    accounts to be rate-limited. We will be adding more batch-sending options in the future.\n  - The `z` key no longer incorrectly dispatches the undo command.\n  - Participants inside a message are no longer mailto: links.\n  - When linking Fastmail accounts, N1 autofills the correct IMAP and SMTP settings.\n  - Thread drag-and-drop now works consistently.\n  - The sidebar now displays accounts in the same order you choose in Preferences > Accounts.\n  - On Windows, the unread count is properly displayed when you hover over the system tray.\n  - Correctly update selected contact profile in contact sidebar.\n  - The \"Nylas N1 Help\" menu item now directs you to a better help page.\n  - Hashtags and @mentions in the contact sidebar now link out to Twitter.\n  - Command-clicking links in the contact sidebar now opens them in the background.\n  - The composer no longer scrolls horizontally when a long link is present in your email.\n  - Performance of snoozing has been improved thanks to a new database index.\n  - N1 no longer launches into an empty mailbox view in some scenarios.\n- Design:\n  - We're in the process of moving annoying \"bars\" displayed across the top of the\n    main window into the lower left. Stay tuned!\n- Development:\n  - N1 now uses Electron 1.4.1 and Chromium 53, which uses less memory and performs\n    better in many scenarios. We've also upgraded to React 15.3.\n  - `N1.sh` now supports working copy paths that contain spaces.\n  - SQL queries are now correctly escaped and logged to the console.\n  - `Utils.deepClone` now correctly clones Dates.\n  - When printing to the console within specs, the name of the current spec is now included.\n  - Fix stack traces for APIErrors, plus report more errors around tasks and\n    streaming connections.\n  - More database code has been transitioned to ES6.\n  - ComposerExtension methods `applyTransformsToDraft` and `unapplyTransformsToDraft`\n    have been deprecated in favor of `applyTransformsForSending` and `unapplyTransformsForSending`.\n    In order to facilitate transformations on the draft body, these new extension\n    APIs receive a DOM tree of the draft body so no HTML string manipulation is necessary.\n  - Backoff timer for streaming connections now has \"jitter\", which should help\n    us avoid the thundering herd problem if we have some kind of API outage\n    affecting a wide number of clients.\n"

      "body": "- Features:\n  - 24h clock: You can now choose to view times in the app in 24h clock format. You\n    can select this option within the General Preferences.\n  - Installer: Adds a new notification bar for mac users only that warns you if\n    N1 is not in your Applications folder, and gives you the option to move it to your\n    Applications folder. This prevents errors that can prevent you from receiving\n    autoupdates.\n- Fixes:\n  - We now display better error messaging when we can't save your credentials\n    to the system keychain.\n  - Phishing detection now uses case insensitive detection when inspecting\n    emails.\n  - Issues connecting to the Clearbit and Keybase API's are now resolved.\n  - Fixed issue where new windows wouldn't refresh themselves.\n  - Long signatures inside preferences can now be scrolled.\n  - You can now correctly select to enable link tracking or open tracking\n    independently when sending and tracking multiple recipients.\n  - When clicking the top of the composer body, the top of the text content is\n    now correctly focused, rather than the end.\n  - The subject field is now correctly focused when a composer is opened via a\n    mailto link.\n  - MailMerge will no longer error when trying to send after previewing contents\n    as the recipients will recieve them. Also, the cursor styles for MailMerge tokens\n    have been updated to indicate that they can be dragged.\n  - We don't open dev tools when `applyTransformsToDraft` fails when sending.\n  - The autoupdater now properly uses your Nylas ID when available.\n  - We no longer retry send, and just show an error dialog when sending fails.\n- Note:\n  - We no longer distribute a .dmg file for macs. Download the .zip file instead and drag your `Nylas N1.app` to `/Applications`\n"

They\n    now act on your email within one minute of your scheduled time.\n  - **Linux Unread Badge**: On Linux systems with the Unity Launcher, an unread count\n    appears on the app icon.\n  - **Keybase**: We've improved decryption support and messaging in the Keybase plugin,\n    making it even easier to encrypt and decrypt your email.\n- Fixes:\n  - N1 now supports email addresses and URLs containing unicode characters. #1920\n  - The composer no longer lags significantly when replying to emails with large\n    amounts of quoted text.\n  - Inline images render properly in emails that specify a \"base\" URL in their HTML.\n  - HTML emails with a body height of `100%` or `inherit` now render\n    at the correct height instead of appearing 10px tall. #1280\n  - Reading emails now removes related system notifications #1393\n  - Notifications are now displayed in the correct order as they are received #2517\n  - Mail merge no longer complains about empty rows, and removing a column no\n    longer removes data from other columns when some rows are missing values.\n  - When you delete a folder, it now disappears immediately.\n  - When closing a draft, your most recent changes reliably appear in the draft list.\n  - Emails sent from Outlook for Mac that contain `contenteditable` nodes no longer\n    appear to be editable when viewed in N1.\n  - \"Per recipient\" read receipts and open tracking are no longer enabled when\n    you're sending to more than 10 people, since they can cause you to go over\n    your provider's sending quota more quickly.\n  - On linux, the menu bar automatically hides. #1181\n  - In Preferences > General, a new option allows you to clear your local cache\n    and / or reset your accounts in N1.\n  - In Preferences > General, a new option allows you to disable spellcheck.\n    Note: You must relaunch N1 for this setting to take effect.\n  - When N1 prompts you to \"Sign in to Gmail\", it displays the authentication URL\n    so you can copy it if the page does not appear in your browser properly.\n  - When saving several attachments, N1 does not repeatedly open the same Finder window. #1044\n  - If you've disabled the Important label in Gmail preferences, you no longer see\n    a lowercase `important` label on your mail.\n  - We now support Linux Mint 18\n  - The \"View on Github\" plugin now works as expected.\n  - Renaming a label inside another label now maintains the hierarchy as expected. #2402\n- Development:\n  - Local Sync Engine: When you first setup N1, you can choose to link it to a\n    version of the sync engine on your local machine. This is a developer / hacker\n    feature and we recommend you use the hosted infrastructure! Creating a Nylas\n    Identity is no longer required when using a custom environment.\n"

(Coming in the next few days via email!) Create a Nylas ID to continue using N1, and look out for a coupon email!\n  - **Read Receipts**: You can now see which recipients read your emails and clicked\n    links (Gmail and IMAP only!) Click the purple eye on an email, or look in the\n    Activity view for details.\n  - **Encryption powered by Keybase**: Enable the new Encryption plugin to quickly and\n    easily encrypt messages in the composer using public keys found on Keybase.\n  - **Account Management**: A new, refined authentication process makes it easy to\n    link accounts and auto-completes settings for hundreds of email services.\n  - **QuickSchedule**: You can now place “Propose Times” and “Meeting Request”\n    event cards anywhere in your message body.\n  - **Mail Merge**: You can now preview emails as a recipient, drag and drop tokens\n    within the message body, and more. Mail merge is also more robust at sending\n    large sets of emails.\n  - Unified “Important” is now displayed in Unified Inbox when one or more Gmail\n    accounts are present.\n- Fixes:\n  - A new option allows you to use a 24-hour clock within N1.\n  - A new option allows you to show the total number of messages on the app’s badge icon.\n  - N1 no longer tries to adapt Outlook emoji, fixing a bug where images would become\n    emoji in some cases.\n  - N1 no longer hangs after restarting when it was in the middle of sending an email.\n  - N1 waits longer for Exchange AutoDiscovery to complete (2+ minutes).\n  - When editing a draft queued for sending in the past, times no longer indicate the future.\n  - The Activity view only shows activity from the currently focused email account(s).\n  - A \"Window\" menu is now present on Linux and Windows so you can open the Developer Tools.\n  - When changing labels, the toasts at the bottom of the window are more succinct.\n  - After switching themes, the next composer opens with the correct theme.\n  - Updates to your accounts no longer cause your selected thread to be de-selected.\n  - The search index no longer contains duplicates in some scenarios, which\n    made it impossible to view search results.\n  - Messages no longer fail to render when using N1 in some specific timezones.\n  - Accented characters are now supported in template names.\n  - A new hotkey (default: z) allows you to Snooze mail with the keyboard.\n  - \"Add Folder / Label\" is shown in the sidebar when you hover anywhere in a\n    section, making it more discoverable.\n  - Labels / folders shown in the picker are now sorted the way they appear in the sidebar.\n  - Empty state images are now included for important and spam views.\n  - Re-ordering of mail rules now works as expected.\n  - The RPM linux version of N1 now links against the correctly named keyring dependency.\n  - Trying to connect to the Nylas API with a very old cursor no longer results\n    in an infinite loading loop in some scenarios.\n"

Note that mail is still sent from your\n    personal address, and provider rate limits may apply.\n  - Activity View: Receive notifications as recipients interact with messages you send\n    with read receipts and link tracking enabled. More activity improvements are coming soon!\n  - Unread: A new view in the sidebar allows you to view all unread emails in your inbox.\n  - Menus: N1's menus now include many more of the available keyboard shortcuts.\n- Performance:\n  - Secondary windows, like the calendar picker, open faster.\n  - N1 uses ~20% less RAM, thanks to hot window optimizations.\n  - Unified Starred, Drafts, and Unread views load faster thanks to SQLite partial indexes.\n- Improvements:\n  - The thread list no longer becomes detached in some scenarios, causing archive\n    and other actions not to take effect.\n  - Fixes a regression, allowing you to create lists by typing `-`.\n  - Fixes a hard loop when trying to launch with a very old sync cursor.\n  - A unified \"spam\" folder is now available alongside Inbox, Sent, etc.\n  - Shift+J and Shift+K now allow you to select multiple threads in the Gmail and Inbox shortcut sets.\n  - Command-clicking links on Mac OS X opens them behind N1.\n  - Names like \"Gotow, Ben (USA)\" are now properly parsed into first and last names.\n  - \"Launch on System Start\" is now compatible with XDG-compliant Linux desktops.\n  - Inline image attachments less than 12k no longer cause the attachments icon\n    to be shown, since they are almost always signatures.\n  - You can now open the theme picker from the appearance preferences panel.\n  - When viewing messages, URLs that contain email addresses are now \"linkified\" properly.\n  - URLs always show their target on hover, even if overridden in the message HTML.\n  - Trying to open CC or BCC no longer collapses the participants fields on slow computers.\n  - On Mac OS X, open and save dialogs are attached to the window toolbar correctly.\n  - On Mac OS X, the status bar icon for N1 now inverts correctly when clicked.\n  - Opening N1 to the Drafts view now works as expected.\n  - Viewing Outlook emails with emoji no longer results in bad HTML styling.\n  - Empty emails with open or link tracking enabled are no longer saved when closed.\n  - Read receipts are no longer included in quoted text when creating new messages.\n  - Paste and match style now uses the correct shortcut on Mac OS X.\n  - The Window menu now lists all the open windows.\n  - The GitHub sidebar now correctly shows repos with the most stars when the user\n    has many pages of repositories.\n- Developer:\n  - N1 now uses React `0.15` and Electron `0.37.7`\n  - Composer React components can now access the `session` and `draft` as props,\n    rather than just the `draftClientId`.\n  - We've removed `space-pen`, `jQuery` and several other dependencies.\n  - Keymaps and menus in packages must now be in `JSON` format rather than `CSON`\n  - The `KeymapManager` and `MenuManager` have been re-written to remove unwanted\n    features and weight we inherited from Atom and improve compatibility with our\n    React-based stack. CSS selectors are no longer used to scope anything.\n  - Menus are now specified using Mousetrap syntax. `CmdOrCtrl-A` => `mod+shift+a`\n  - This update transitions `config.cson` to `config.json`. We will be removing\n    `CSON` support in an upcoming release.\n"

An updated dark theme is coming soon.\n- **Fixes**:\n  - Warnings now appear in the main window if we are unable to connect to your email provider.\n  - The Send Later, Snooze and read receipts plugins now alert you if you are not using our hosted infrastructure.\n  - The Autoload Images and Snooze date input field is now locale-aware.\n  - Composer:\n    - N1 cleans up drafts properly after sending if an autosave occurred immediately\n      before your message was sent.\n    - The emoji picker now matches emoji against more common words, like `:thumbsup`!\n    - Link tracking correctly modifies only `http://` and `https://` links\n    - When sending two responses to the same email, the second email no longer appears\n      to be sending in some scenarios.\n  - Reading:\n    - Messages now show a loading indicator while they're being downloaded, and you can\n      retry if the download is interrupted.\n    - The \"Sent\" view now orders your messages by \"last sent message\".\n    - The \"At 2:30PM, Mark wrote...\" byline is now recognized as part of quoted text.\n    - Deleted messages are filtered from the conversation view, and you can show them by clicking \"Show Deleted Messages.\" Threads in trash and spam are also excluded from the Starred and Gmail label views.\n    - \"Archive\" no longer removes the label you are currently viewing.\n    - Delete and backspace no longer follow Gmail's \"remove from view\" behavior. For Gmail's behavior, use the `y` shortcut.\n  - Attachments:\n    - Downloads that fail are now retried properly when you interact with them.\n    - Changing an attachment name when saving it no longer clears the file extension.\n  - Account Setup:\n    - The \"Welcome to N1\" screens now emphasize that it is cloud-based.\n    - You can use IP addresses as IMAP / SMTP and Exchange domains.\n    - You can now check \"Require SSL\" during IMAP / SMTP setup and N1 will not try plaintext authentication.\n    - N1 now displays better error messages for a wide variety of auth issues.\n    - Themes are no longer applied in the account setup window.\n  - Temporary:\n    - N1 no longer syncs Drafts with Gmail, avoiding several critical issues our\n      platform team is working to resolve. (Drafts duplicating or appearing sent as you edit.)\n- **Cleanup**:\n  - All sample plugins have been converted from CoffeeScript to ES2016.\n  - The `<Popover>` component has been deprecated in favor of `<FixedPopover>` which is more flexible.\n  - Running specs from the application no longer resets your account configuration.\n  - N1 no longer adds `N1` and `apm` to `/usr/bin`\n"

Like it the old way? Use the zoom feature in Workspace preferences!\n  - The N1 icon is now more of a \"sea foam\" green, which helps it stand out among\n    standard system icons, and features a square design on Windows.\n  - Tons and tons of additional polish.\n- Developer:\n  - A new `MetadataStore` and `model.pluginMetadata` concept allows plugins to associate\n    arbitrary data with threads and messages (like snooze times and link IDs).\n- Many, many other bug fixes were incorporated into this release. Take a look at\n  closed GitHub issues that made it into this release here:  \n  \n  https://github.com/nylas/N1/issues?q=updated%3A2016-02-07..2016-02-25+is%3Aclosed\n"

In addition to the Inbox, we've\n  unified Search, Drafts, Sent, Trash, and more.\n- **Send and Archive**: You can now choose Send and Archive when replying to threads.\n  More \"Send variants\" are coming soon, including Send Later and Undo Send, and\n  you can choose a default in Preferences.\n- **Account Sidebar**: We've rebuilt the account sidebar to address your feedback:\n  - Rename folders and labels by right clicking / double clicking\n  - Re-order accounts from Preferences > Accounts\n  - See unread counts for all accounts when viewing \"All Accounts\"\n  - Collapse label and folder views\n- **Send As**: You can now choose which account or alias a new draft should be sent\n  from, and choose a default account in Preferences > Sending.\n- **Launch On System Start**: N1 can now launch in the background via an option in Preferences.\n- **Search**: You can now archive / trash items in the search results view.\n- **Outbox**: N1 now keeps mail it isn't able to send in your Drafts folder, and\n  sends when you reconnect to the internet.\n\n#### Performance:\n- The conversation list has been rebuilt using a brand new \"live query\"\n  API that yields great performance and minimizes costly database queries.\n- The conversation list data source no longer requires an accurate item count,\n  removing frequent and expensive count queries.\n\n#### Development:\n- `AccountStore.current()` has been deprecated and replaced with the concept of\n  \"Mailbox Perspectives\" which are views of mail data.\n- Developer > Toggle Screenshot Mode now allows you to hide text in the app to\n  take a screenshot.\n- `window.eval` has been disabled in N1. (Issue #1159)\n\n#### Fixes:\n- On Mac OS X, N1 no longer crashes when you change language or spellcheck preferences.\n- Contact autocompletion is now unified, uses dramatically less memory, and does\n  not depend on the selected account\n- When viewing all accounts, the tray icon and dock icon also display\n  the unified unread count.\n- You can now make N1 the default mail client on Windows.\n- You can now re-order mail rules and use \"starred\" as a rule criteria.\n- You can now authenticate IMAP / SMTP accounts where the username is not the\n  email address. (Fixed in the Nylas Sync Engine.)\n- The maximum width of the account list has been increased.\n- And many, many, many other fixes!\n\n#### Coming Soon:\n- Our PR has landed in Electron, unblocking Swipe to Archive.\n"
