If you don't have Chrome installed on your machine that plugin may not, and most likely will not exist on your computer causing this application to not work.\n\nOn OS X at least it may also warn you about this being from an unidentified developer, and that is because I can't reconcile spending $100 to get a developer license and sign the application. If you don't trust it you can build it from the source code using the steps in the README, or you can right click on it and select `Open`, and there will be an option on that same warning dialog that will allow you to open it anyways.\n"
