      "body": "- Fix for a bug which hung the app when moving a frame into its own tab.\n- Command palette is now more discoverable and works somewhat as a replacement for the RMB context menu.\n- When the command palette has no filter, then it groups the entries more like a context menu.\n- `show` command now supports showing multiple files.\n- `show` command can show data from stdin / pipes. It also automatically detects the type of the data using similar techniques to the unix `find` command.\n- `show` command gained explicit `charset`, `filename` and `mimetype` parameters for use when showing data from stdin.\n- `from` command also accepts multiple frame IDs.\n- `from` command also gained `xargs` style functionality where multiple frames can be fetched, put into temp files and then run a command on them. (for example, use `diff` on the contents of two frames.)\n- Dependencies have cleaned up.\n\nDon't forget to grab the new commands.zip too.\n"
