      "body": ":rocket: Initial beta release.\n\nAboutCode Manager is only compatible with scans from [ScanCode Toolkit v2.0.0.rc1](https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/tag/v2.0.0.rc1) and above.\n\nScans imported into the app need to contain the file information data. Therefore, the `-i` option needs to be used in your ScanCode command. For example:\n\n``` bash\n./scancode -clipf\n```\n\nTo install, download and extract the release for your operating system from the archives below. Then, run the AboutCode-Manager application from the extracted directory.\n\nFor more information on how to use the app see the [wiki](https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-manager/wiki).\n"
