      "body": "- **Breaking change!** All functions from `nacl.util` have been removed. These\n  functions are no longer available:\n  \n  ```\n  nacl.util.decodeUTF8\n  nacl.util.encodeUTF8\n  nacl.util.decodeBase64\n  nacl.util.encodeBase64\n  ```\n  \n  If want to continue using them, you can include\n  https://github.com/dchest/tweetnacl-util-js package:\n  \n  ```\n  <script src=\"nacl.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"nacl-util.min.js\"></script>\n  ```\n  \n  or\n  \n  ```\n  var nacl = require('tweetnacl');\n  nacl.util = require('tweetnacl-util');\n  ```\n  \n  However it is recommended to use better packages that have wider\n  compatibility and better performance. Functions from `nacl.util` were never\n  intended to be robust solution for string conversion and were included for\n  convenience: cryptography library is not the right place for them.\n  \n  Currently calling these functions will throw error pointing to\n  `tweetnacl-util-js` (in the next version this error message will be removed).\n- Improved detection of available random number generators, making it possible\n  to use `nacl.randomBytes` and related functions in Web Workers without\n  changes.\n- Changes to testing (see README).\n"

This was unlike NaCl's API, which dealt with\n  signed messages (concatenation of signature and message).\n  \n  The new API is:\n  \n  ```\n  nacl.sign(message, secretKey) -> signedMessage\n  nacl.sign.open(signedMessage, publicKey) -> message | null\n  ```\n  \n  Since detached signatures are common, two new API functions were introduced:\n  \n  ```\n  nacl.sign.detached(message, secretKey) -> signature\n  nacl.sign.detached.verify(message, signature, publicKey) -> true | false\n  ```\n  \n  (Note that it's `verify`, not `open`, and it returns a boolean value, unlike\n  `open`, which returns an \"unsigned\" message.)\n- NPM package now comes without `test` directory to keep it small.\n"
