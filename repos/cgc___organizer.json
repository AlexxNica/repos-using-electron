      "body": "the v1.0.0 release of the ENGAGE organizer! won't really be used by anybody that doesn't know why they would use this, but here it is!\n\nThe Organizer is a tool built to facilitate uploads to the Flywheel data management system. I've made some modifications to it to make it appropriate for the ENGAGE use-case. We use the Organizer to upload behavioral and physiological data. The Organizer can detect which files haven't been synced to the server yet and only uploads those, so it's a great tool to use right after a scan.\n\nhere's a quick walkthrough of the organizer:\n![tutorial](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1276728/20545894/a128ac20-b0c6-11e6-87a1-fa2edbd00ce7.gif)\n1. Click on \"Click here to select files\". Select the directory where files are stored. On Windows, this folder will look like it has no files in it, but as long as you have navigated to the right directory, the files will be found by the Organizer.\n2. Review the files that will be uploaded and then hit \"Next Step\". Most historical data has been uploaded, so this will usually only list the data for the most recent scan. If you don't see your most recent scan, please expand the \"Parsing Errors\" section, take a screenshot, and report this issue to Carlos Correa (cgc@stanford.edu).\n   1. If you're feeling adventurous, you can dig around in the \"Parsing Errors\" section to see if the most recent scan is listed there. The Organizer will show warnings when it can't find an exact match for subject code, so this can be helpful if you have misspelled a subject's code.\n3. Click \"Upload to flywheel.io\"\n4. To upload files, click \"Load Groups\", confirm that PanLab is selected, and click \"Upload to flywheel.io\". You should see a \"Success\" message in the lower-left. Close the program at this point. If you see any error message, take a screenshot and report the issue to Carlos Correa (cgc@stanford.edu).\n"
