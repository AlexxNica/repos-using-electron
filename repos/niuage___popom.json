      "body": "## Valuable drops\n\nThis release allows you to log valuable item drops. They'll show up on the site like so:\n\n![http://i.imgur.com/3gLaGpT.png](http://i.imgur.com/3gLaGpT.png)\n\n## How does it work?\n\nBefore, to log map drops, you would do: `> drop 13 10`. You can still do that. But you can also copy an item (Ctrl + C while hovering over the item in your inventory), and then just send the `> drop` command. That's it, the item should show up on the site a few seconds later.\n\nTo make this process easier, get the AHK script here: [pathofmaps.com/pom.ahk](http://pathofmaps.com/pom.ahk). With this script running, you only have to hover over the item, and press `ctrl + d`. If you do that several times in a row, please wait for at least 2 seconds in between each command, to allow the app the time to receive the command and send the item.\n\nSupported items:\n- maps\n- uniques (any type)\n- divination cards\n- currencies\n- fragments\n\nGems are not yet supported, but they probably will (and the quality and level should be logged too).\n\n---\n\nIf you have questions, post them on the official thread: [https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1482223](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1482223).\n"
