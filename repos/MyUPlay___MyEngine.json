This is required anyways when we introduce electron as the primary toolkit for managing the screen overlays.\n\n(The release only contains a linux release for now, we will add windows support soon.)\n"

It contains enough features to adequately render without any external shortcuts or help.\n- Scene Graph is based on Three.js with some mutation for C++ and internal adaptations\n- Shaders are completely custom and written to use node based programming and a glsl-optimizer to ensure the shaders use as little footprint as possible while still being easy to create and manipulate.\n- BoxGeometry is implemented as it was in Three.js. (Considered part of extras but used for testing the first version)\n\nThe test/demo is attached to this release. A simple cube of dimensions 10, 10, 10 and side segmentations of 8, 4, 2 with a normal shader applied. The cube will spin and the demo will run until closed. This release only contains a linux binary. Future releases are expected to contain windows and linux.\n"
