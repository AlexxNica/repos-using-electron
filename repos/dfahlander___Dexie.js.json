Have tested that async/await can be used within transaction scopes in the following configurations:\n  - Babel\n  - Typescript 2.1\n  - Natively in Edge 14 ( with experimental javascript flags on )\n  - Natively in Chrome 55 beta.\n\n# Changed Behavior\n\n#### [PrematureCommitError](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Dexie.PrematureCommitError)\n\nPrematureCommitError makes it visible when you accedently fall outside the transaction zone and start using the database transactionless without knowing so.\n\nBefore, if you'd use a non-Dexie Promise and then continue using database after that, you wouldn't detect that your code runs outside the transaction and the code could succeed silently without you noticing it did stuff transactionless.\n\nNow, if the indexedDB transaction commits before your returned promise is completed,  [PrematureCommitError](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Dexie.PrematureCommitError) will be thrown. That is; if you for example await jQuery.ajax() within your transaction block, the transaction will now fail with PrematureCommitError. In earlier releases, it would sometimes fail with TransactionInactiveError() when this occurred, but only if the zone persisted when trying to do another db call.\n"

Dexie v1.x is being maintained continously in parallell with the development of 2.x on the `master-1` branch.\n\n## Support for 'unhandledrejection' event\n\nIt's incredibly easy to forget catching promises. The HTML standard has evolved to support a global 'unhandledrejection' event to make sure no error goes unseen for the developer. Dexie 1.5 now supports and embraces the use of this event instead of the previous custom `Dexie.Promise.on('error', ...)`.\n\n``` js\nwindow.onunhandledrejection = function (event) {\n    var reason = event.reason;\n    console.warn('Unhandled Promise Rejection: ' + (reason && (reason.stack || reason));\n    event.preventDefault(); // Prohibit default handler from logging to console.\n};\n```\n\nWorks also with window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', ...);\n\nWorks on legacy browsers as well (Tested on IE11, Firefox 45, Edge 13 and Chrome 49).\n\nSearch your code for `Promise.on('error`, `Promise.on(\"error` or `Promise.on.error` to see if you should go over to the standard way instead. I've deprecated `Promise.on.error` but it will continue to work in 1.x. In 2.0 it's obsolete.\n\n## Bugfixes\n- Fixes #326 Broken sourceMappingURL for dexie.min.js\n- [Circular dependency (rollup.js issue)](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/issues/310)\n- [Issues when used in Ionic v2 (potentially Cordova as well?)](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/issues/333)\n- [AbortError when utilizing Table.mapToClass() on class with readonly properties](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/commit/e0564cc40f9ded45f4b361c098f967d556b7c2e9)\n- [Bugfix: Infinite loop with db.on('ready') if error occurrs](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/commit/9bb3d9b56facfba58402571e137058a3462ec0fb)\n  (Can affects Dexie.Observable and DexieSyncable)\n\n## Build- and deployment tools\n- Upgrading build and transpiler tools\n- Prepared for supporting maintainance releases on 1.x branch while continuing to develop Dexie v2.x.\n\n## Deprecations (See https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Deprecations)\n- Transaction.table (will be continously supported in 2.x as well)\n- Transaction.&#91;table&#93; (will be continously supported in 2.x as well)\n- Transaction.tables (will be continously supported in 2.x as well)\n- Transaction.error (will be obsolete in 2.x)\n- Transaction.complete (will be obsolete in 2.x)\n- Dexie.Promise.on('error', ...) (Will be obsolete in 2.x)\n"

      "body": "First beta-release of the 2.0 track.\n\n# Support for async functions (native and transpiled)\n- Typescript 2.0 compatible async await within transactions without quirks.\n- Compatible with the native async await in Edge 14 and Chrome 53 (with experimental flags on)\n- Should be compatible witht transpiled async await using babel (not verified yet)\n- Should be compatible with Angular2 and Zone.js when using typescript's transpiled async functions (not verified yet)\n\n# No need to 'stick to Dexie.Promise'\n\nNative (or polyfilled) Promise can be safely used within transaction scopes. So for example, the use of `Promise.all(...)` would break transaction in Dexie v1.x but works perfectly well in Dexie v2.x without having to do `Dexie.Promise.all(...)`. We're solving the browser-issues described in #317 by polyfilling the global Promise to play well with indexedDB transactions within the transaction scope only, and revert the patching for every leave from the transaction scope. This is possible only because of the built-in [zone system](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Promise.PSD) that Dexie has.\n\n# Prepared to retire Dexie.Promise in a future major version\n\nDexie v2.x will keep using Dexie.Promise, but the work needed retire Dexie.Promise in favour of native Promise has been implemented, and once the problem described in #317 is fully solved widely by the affected browsers (IE, Safari and Firefox) we will do that shift. In the meantime, I've started the mounting down of Dexie.Promise-specific API:s so that the user shouldn't have to think about Dexie.Promise anymore. Code will look the same as soon as we do the switch to native Promise.\n\n# Breaking Changes / Backward Compatibility\n\nDexie 2.0 is built with backward compatibility in mind, but there are a few things that you would might need to fix before migrating:\n1. Dexie.Promise.on('error') is deprecated in Dexie 1.5.0 and obsolete in Dexie 2.0.0. [Deprecation notes](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Deprecations#promiseonerror)\n2. db.on('error') is deprecated in Dexie 1.5.0 and obsolete in Dexie 2.0.0. [Deprecation notes](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Deprecations#dexieonerror--dbonerror)\n\nA full story of obsolete parts of the API is listed in the wiki under [Deprecations](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Deprecations). Note that some of the deprecations are still available in 2.0 but are planned to go obsolete in 3.0.\n\nThe main reason for the major version increment, else than the obsolete methods, is the new way that db.transaction() works - specifically that it patches the global promise within the transaction zone, wich is a change of a behavior in an existing API. db.transaction() is still backward compatible though and you don't need to change your transaction code.\n"

      "body": "## Optimized, simplified and debug friendlier.\n\nMuch of the code base has been rewritten since v1.3.6 for the purposes of both optimization and code simplification.\n\n### Async stacks for Easier Debugging\n- Async stack support on all thrown errors in debug mode.\n- Debug mode is defined via `Dexie.debug` static property.\n- Dexie.debug will default to true when served from localhost.\n\n``` js\nDexie.debug = true; // Enables long stacks (Default on when served from localhost)\n\ndb.friends.toArray(friends => {\n    return friends.map(friend => friend.name);\n}).then (names => {\n    console.log(names.join(', ');\n}).then (()=> {\n    throw new Error (\"oops!\");\n}).catch (function (e) {\n    console.error (\"Oops: \" + e.stack); // Will see long stacks containing async flow:\n         // Error: oops!\n         //    at yourSource:file:line\n         // From previous:\n         //    at yourSource of prevous promise\n         //    ...\n         // From previous:\n         //    at yourSrouce even earlier...\n         //    ...\n});\n```\n\n### Reusable Collections\n\nIf you prepare a collection:\n\n``` js\nvar collection = db.friends.where('age').above(25);\n```\n\n...you can reuse that collection in any transaction later:\n\n``` js\ndb.transaction('r', db.friends, function() {\n    collection.toArray(function (result) {\n        console.log(JSON.stringify(result));\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn previous versions, Collections where bound to the transaction where they were created.\n\n### Optimizations\n- Using new indexedDB methods getAll() & getAllKeys when available in IDBObjectStore & IDBIndex.\n- Faster promise implementation. Chaining .then() on returned promises will execute in a virtual micro-tick engine which ensures maximum performance as well as keeping indexedDB transactions alive no matter how long you chains are. Previous version did also keep indexedDB transaction alive, but executed then-handlers in a long and clumsy stack, which failed to comply fully with the A+ spec and made it cumbersome to debug and could theoretically end up in a stack overflow if utilizing very long promise chains.\n- No leaking arguments enables V8 to optimize more code.\n- No dynamic properties on Transaction objects.\n- Fewer layers when accessing a transaction.\n\n### Totally Rewritten Promise\n\nThe Promise class has been rewritten totally in order to be more optimized and execute all tasks in a virtual indexedDB-compliant microtick engine.\n\n### Cleaner Code\n\nDexie.js and its other modules has been revised and some complex methods has been simplified.\n\n### Architectural Changes\n- [db.transaction()](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Dexie.transaction%28%29) will now always execute the scope function asynchronically. In previous versions, the scope function could be executed either directly (synchronically) or asynchronically depending on whether the database was ready, or if a parent transaction was locked.\n- Table instances are singletons of WriteableTable now. There's no more need to dynamically generate Table instances when creating a transaction instance because the Table methods will inspect ongoing transaction runtime instead. A future major release (2.0) will likely deprecate WriteableTable and instead incorporate it into class Table, as with WriteableCollection to be incorporated into Collection. Table related properties on Transaction is subject of deprecation as well, since it's returned instances aren't bound to the transaction.\n\n### Other\n- Issue fixed: Promise.on('error') wasn't signaled for rejections outside transactions: https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/pull/242/commits/e7f32752f1c08b2dc0b485b915e5032e373e6f51\n- Behave if indexedDB implementatino throws undefined or null: https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/pull/242/commits/b82be5c9aed3b87c535f84099d78b7c790446f3f\n- Wrong class expected in options to Dexie constructor 614a456d03858c2342de28c95667ced26a9ddeeb.\n- #130 resolved (No leaking arguments, https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers#32-leaking-arguments)\n- Resolves issues #127 and #245.\n- Fixed issue #248: 'modifications' object in 'updating' hook can be bizarre.\n\nSee also pull request #242 which contains most of the changes in this release.\n\n### Known Issues\n- Open [issues](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/issues/)\n- Specifically, this version will trigger [this zonejs issue](https://github.com/angular/zone.js/issues/287) when used together with karma-source-map-support. This is not a Dexie issue, but since Dexie v1.4.0 performs a feature detection by calling `new Error().stack` at startup, it will fail there if karma-source-map-support and zone.js are loaded.\n"

Setting a custom scheduler inactivates the internal virtual micro-tick engine and will always use the provided scheduler to call then-handlers in Promises. When using a custom scheduler, pay attention to whether indexedDB transaction survives your scheduler or not. setTimout() would not survive it. setImmediate() maybe.\n\n### Cleaner Code\n\nDexie.js and its other modules has been revised and some complex methods has been simplified.\n\n### Reusable Collections\n\nIf you prepare a collection:\n\n``` js\nvar collection = db.friends.where('age').above(25);\n```\n\n...you can reuse that collection in any transaction later:\n\n``` js\ndb.transaction('r', db.friends, function() {\n    collection.toArray(function (result) {\n        console.log(JSON.stringify(result));\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn previous versions, Collections where bound to the transaction where they were created.\n\n### Other\n- Issue fixed: Promise.on('error') wasn't signaled for rejections outside transactions: https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/pull/242/commits/e7f32752f1c08b2dc0b485b915e5032e373e6f51\n- Behave if indexedDB implementatino throws undefined or null: https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/pull/242/commits/b82be5c9aed3b87c535f84099d78b7c790446f3f\n- Wrong class expected in options to Dexie constructor 614a456d03858c2342de28c95667ced26a9ddeeb.\n- #130 resolved (No leaking arguments, https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers#32-leaking-arguments)\n\nSee also pull request #242 which contains most of the changes in this release.\n"

Also, I believe it is more conventional to point jsnext:main to src, not dist)\n- Include addons in bower packages (not npm, because they have their own npm packages)\n- Removed es6 output from dist and instead point jsnext:main to src/Dexie.js\n- Refactored Dexie.js some more - extracted more classes and functions.\n- Unit tests can utilize \"spawnedTest\" instead of \"asyncTest\" for prettier code using yield.\n\nMinor changes:\n- Renamed class Dexie.events to Dexie.Events (backward compatible though!)\n- Dexie.errnames changed (commit d24b098728d4cfb8af3f62684aa27eba548a32fa)\n- Support for arrow functions in [modify](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/WriteableCollection.modify%28%29) (9e9ae0515308d5b771759d630de20bd06737e524)\n"

      "body": "Dexie v1.3.0 was at last released, six months after the previous release, 1.2.0. There are a lot of news, check out!\n\n### New features\n- New WhereClause methods\n  \n  [anyOfIgnoreCase()](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/WhereClause.anyOfIgnoreCase%28%29)\n  [inAnyRange()](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/WhereClause.inAnyRange%28%29)\n  [startsWithAnyOfIgnoreCase()](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/WhereClause.startsWithAnyOfIgnoreCase%28%29)\n- Improved WhereClause methods:\n  \n  [noneOf()](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/WhereClause.noneOf%28%29) _Supports large array as argument_\n  [notEqual()](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/WhereClause.notEqual%28%29) _More efficient_\n- Support for [using yield (as await)](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/Simplify-with-yield)\n- New method for improved performance when adding thousands of items into a table:\n  \n  [bulkAdd()](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/wiki/WriteableTable.bulkAdd%28%29)\n- Updated Typescript definition.\n  \n  Module based instead of global.\n  Supports latest typescript compiler.\n  typings attribute in package.json eliminates the need of DefinitelyTyped and tsd.\n  \"typescript.definitions\"attribute in package.json makes tsd detect the typings in github.\n- Support for the new standard module format \"es6\" (separate output).\n\n### File Structure Update\n- The files in the `dist` directory has been moved. `dist/latest`is removed and files are put directly under `dist` and are all in lowercase.\n- Dist files are removed from the `master` branch. They are only checked in by the `release.sh` script in the `releases` branch so that each release will have them (so that our bower users get happy).\n- Addons are no more part of the npm package (or bower package). They are also ES6 based and have their own build system. They are released separately as their own npm modules\n  \n  ```\n  npm install dexie-observable --save\n  npm install dexie-syncable --save\n  ```\n- Bower users can also install the npm modules through:\n  \n  ```\n  bower install https://npmcdn.com/dexie-observable@SEMVER/bower.zip\n  bower install https://npmcdn.com/dexie-syncable@SEMVER/bower.zip\n  ```\n  \n  ...where SEMVER is a version query in semver format, such as 0.1.x, ~0.1.2, ^0.1.3 etc.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\nWow, there's been a lot of small little fixes. 6 months are hard to conclude here. Read the [commit log](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/commits/master) to see the details.\n\n### Build-, Test and Release system\n\nIntroduced scripts for building, testing and releasing Dexie.js. Source code is migrated to the ES6 module format as a base for further refactoring of Dexie.js into separate modules. Now, to contribute to Dexie.js you will need to:\n\n`npm install`\n`npm run build` or `npm run watch`\n\nAnd to test in command line (thanks to @YuriSolovyov)\n`npm test`\n\nThere's a little guide in [README#Contributing](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/blob/master/README.md#contributing) on how to use `npm link` to symlink you github clone to your app's node_modules/dexie, which works perfectly well on windows systems as well.\n"

See more samples in [tests-yield.html](https://github.com/dfahlander/Dexie.js/blob/master/addons/Dexie.Yield/test/tests-yield.html)\n- **Typescript** definition file added (nuget: Install-Package dexie.TypeScript.DefinitelyTyped)\n- Support for **AMD Module Loading** (see samples/requirejs)\n\n#### API Changes\n- Dexie.spawn() deprecated and replaced by Dexie.ignoreTransaction(). Still backward compliant though.\n\n#### Solved Issues\n- Fixed broken CommonJS support (browserify) with sample added.\n- #81: TypeError undefined not an object. Kind of a regression bug. Systems that lacks indexedDB should get a promise rejection on db.open() not a TypeError thrown at them.\n- #102 Empty array in anyOf()\n- Broken intellisense / code completion when using Visual Studio 2013.\n- Transaction/Promise issues #91, #95 and #97 \n- A little bit more defensive to IndexedDBShim issues\n- #62 Performance improvement on mobile devices\n- #100 Must abort upgrade transaction if schema error\n"
