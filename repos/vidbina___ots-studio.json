Currently work is being done to present a open dialog (https://github.com/atom/tree-view/issues/399), allowing the user to select an arbitrary file. At that stage, saving will be enabled again. One can load a test pre-set overlay by clicking on Layers. The idea is that through the properties explorer one will be able to specify a arbitrary overlay, but the plumbing for that is dependent on the dialog issues being resolved.\n\nThe current file is a build for OSX. There is at least 300 MB of data embedded within the executable that can be stripped out, but first things first. The features to be enabled in order of importance are:\n- [x] Edit the network by drawing new nodes and links\n- [ ] Modify the nodes and links through the property editor\n- [ ] Save a networks\n- [ ] Load a network\n- [ ] Draw a background image to be used as overlay\n\n**Objective:** Discover if the drawing logic is somewhat intuitive and what needs to be modified to make drawing somewhat easier for the end-user. Anything related to the properties is not being tested in this run, because the properties pane is not enabled yet. That will be exposed in the next release.\n"
