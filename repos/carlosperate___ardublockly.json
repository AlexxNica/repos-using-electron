So all snapshots in http://ardublockly-builds.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ should run with all the latest changes added to the uncompressed sources.\n- `ardublocklyserver` binary built using Python 3 instead of Python 2, offering better unicode support.\n- PyInstaller no longer required in the codebase, so now is just part of the build dependencies installation (all to do with the server build system, no impact to the user).\n"
