Moved the \"Your search did not return any results.\" notification above the results, because its not always apparent that no results have been returned if you previously had results. (Because the previous set of results are still visible.) [#141](https://github.com/officert/mongotron/pull/141) Thanks to @buzzcloudau\n2. The 'No-results' message was not being displayed if the next query returned an empty result set. Now it show up. [#142](https://github.com/officert/mongotron/pull/142) Thanks to @buzzcloudau\n3. Expose Mongo's `distinct` method in the query editor. [#138](https://github.com/officert/mongotron/pull/138) Thanks to @AndrewBarba \n4. Remove check that `_id` is always a Mongo `ObjectId`. The `_id` property on a Mongo document does not always have to be an `ObjectId`. [#124](https://github.com/officert/mongotron/pull/124) Thanks to  @simonbengtsson\n\n### New features:\n1. Save user preference for query view. Which ever view you use last will be saved as your default. So if you like a particular view more, like the Table View, then it will always default to that. \n"
