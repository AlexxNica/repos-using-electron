Message Save and Send Type ID should be unique ( Save - c3cca2f9-9449-4c1a-80a4-2343f9e147a6 and Send - 523f3110-38e1-4302-86a2-df45f5f8621d ),\n3. Code optimization for Lex and Synclio AnswerPhrase branding,\n4. Enabled CSV mail format for Exportable Message Forms,\n5. Requests has been requeued if message fail to persist in Full History,\n6. Client Feedback UI experience and bug fixes,\n7. Messages will be fetched using combination of Account Number and Unique Pin. So to avoid messages which are not related to new customer who signed up with the existing Account Number from the source pool,\n8. Avoiding Exception Mails in case of IO, Socket Timeout, etc., if the request is handled by requeueing,\n9. Added new Team VC page and\n10. Changed Ajax ready state from 1 to 2. With the confirmation of state 1, connection has been established but some time request failed to reach server. With state 2, it confirms the request has been reached to server, which will avoid message loss and other services.\n\n**_Bug Fix**_\n1. If the Name field left empty and moving the focus to Phone field, if we type numbers in Phone field, it jumps back to Name field,\n2. Current tab index change for Distributed Source and LoopToDo,\n3. Thumbs Up and Thumbs Down LoopToDo change based on application environment ( Live or Staging ),\n4.  API Key's for User Action Tracker and Transfer Board service to persist interactions in FULL History and\n\nAnalytics bug fixes.\n\n—\n You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread.\nView it on GitHub or mute the thread.\n"

You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)\nhttp://www.gmail.com\nhttp://www.facebook.com\n\nSometimes you want numbered lists:\n1. One\n2. Two\n3. Three\n\nSometimes you want bullet points:\n- Start a line with a star\n- Profit!\n\nAlternatively,\n- Dashes work just as well\n- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:\n  - Like this\n  - And this\n\nIf you want to embed images, this is how you do it:\n\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)\n\n# Structured documents\n\nSometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.\n\n### This is a third-tier heading\n\nYou can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.\n\nIf you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:\n\n> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.\n> - Captain Janeway\n\nThere are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:\n\n```\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n```\n\nGitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:\n\n```\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n```\n\nAnd if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:\n\n``` javascript\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n```\n"

Three\n\nSometimes you want bullet points:\n- Start a line with a star\n- Profit!\n\nAlternatively,\n- Dashes work just as well\n- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:\n  - Like this\n  - And this\n\nIf you want to embed images, this is how you do it:\n\n![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)\n\n# Structured documents\n\nSometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings to structure your documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.\n\n### This is a third-tier heading\n\nYou can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.\n\nIf you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:\n\n> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.\n> - Captain Janeway\n\nThere are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:\n\n```\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n```\n\nGitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:\n\n```\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n```\n\nAnd if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:\n\n``` javascript\nif (isAwesome){\n  return true\n}\n```\n"
