      "body": "The big change in this release is a major change to [dat-encoding](http://github.com/juliangruber/dat-encoding) which now uses hex links again, instead of the custom base36 format we were trying to roll out. In the end we decided it just wasn't worth it migrating away from a format that already works for us. This now means that _every_ link you get from dat-desktop will work in the dat cli and [https://dat.land/](https://dat.land/) as well. Kind of pointless to have a suite of dat tools if they can't interoperate!\n\n_That also means, if you had dat-desktop installed before, you now need to `rm -Rf ~/Downloads/dat` before running this version because this upgrade means a schema change to the local db. This is the last time this will be necessary._\n\nAnother new feature is that now if you have a `dat.json` file in your archive - with at least a \".title\" attribute in it, dat-desktop will use this to display a nice title instead of the hex link for an archive.\n\nAnd of course there were various little bug fixes!\n\nCaution: We still consider this release to be a pre-release, as some critical features are still missing, like for example displaying the download percentage of an archive.\n\nIf you're still curious though, just give it a go and tell us what you think! Any feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\nDat out!\n"
