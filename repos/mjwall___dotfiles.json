Finally decided to put together one project with everything I need to get running, including bashrc, screenrc emacs.d and .vim.  Also put my ~/bin scripts in here, since they are needed in my workflow.\n\nLost history on dotemacs.d and dotvim, but that should be fine.  I don't really want to remember all the yaks I shaved.",
