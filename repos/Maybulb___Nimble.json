We've also added themes, which means you can make Nimble look how you want it to.\n- Theming! There is a theme for each color of the rainbow, plus a high contrast theme for those of you who use F.lux or are visually impaired. Pick the theme you want in the Themes menu, accessible via right clicking the Nimble tray icon or the search bar.\n- Some minor interface changes.\n  - You can now plop in a placeholder by pressing the right arrow key.\n  - If there is only one result, the redundant \"Result\" header is no longer there.\n- Bug reporting has been implemented via Bugsnag. Feel free to turn it off in the preferences.\n- Autoupdating!! Nimble will now automatically check to see if there is a new version on each startup. You can toggle this in the preferences.\n- Cleaned up dependencies, making Nimble a good bit smaller, with more stable versions of many packages now being used.\n- Nimble is now code signed, which means you won't get a warning when you try to open it.\n- Fixed a bug where those who installed Nimble via brew cask could not run Nimble on startup.\n- Fixed a bug involving case sensitive filesystems. (#21)\n- Nimble can now be used if your menubar is set to autohide. (#9)\n- @kabiroberai fixed issue #22, thanks!\n- Options file has been moved to `~/.nimble-options.json` due to issues with options saving.\n\nUnfortunately, we had a major code signing problem with release 1.2.1, and we had to pull it down. So instead of re-uploading it, we decided we'd add in some new features for the trouble. We hope you enjoy 1.3.0, and remember that if you have any issues or requests, you can file an issue right here on GitHub and we'll get back to you as soon as possible. If it's easier, you can always contact us via Twitter ([@madebybright](http://twitter.com/madebybright)). If you'd like updates, you should follow us there too!\n\nThanks as always for supporting us and being patient. You're the best.\n"

      "body": "In this update, we changed a lot and added some features you've been asking us for since the very beginning. You deserve this.\n- Multiple results can now be shown, instead of just the one result Wolfram thinks you want to see.\n  - As a result of this, the already experimental feature \"text to speech\" has been removed for the time being.\n- Nimble's resizing is way better now. It fits itself to graphs and plots, but still maintains a nice look.\n- Our wonderful designer man Adam Gethin has created some better icons for Nimble.\n- Minor bugfixes that make all the difference:\n  - Fixed a bug involving Unicode and clipboard copying. _This **totally** hasn't happened before..._ (#6)\n  - Fixed a bug where the user could zoom in on Nimble by two finger double tapping or pinching (whoops!)\n  - Fixed a bug where images could be dragged out of Nimble, totally giving it away that we're using Chromium/Electron (shh, it's a secret).\n"

Seriously, your support has made this all so much better for us.\n\n**Changelog:**\n- Because we are being supported by Wolfram, we added Wolfram|Alpha branding (thanks guys!)\n  - This isn't entirely cosmetic, though. Click on the Wolfram|Alpha logo to go to the corresponding Wolfram|Alpha page for your query. This'll hopefully hold you over until we support multiple results. (coming soon...)\n- There were some issues with how Nimble's interface worked, and we fixed them right up!\n- Right clicking the app no longer closes it. (everyone on Earth shouts a confused \"woo\")\n- Remember how bad the options menu was before? Issues with copying, sharing, and any overall problems with the menus have been fixed.\n- Cosmetically, instead of just immediately resizing itself, Nimble now beautifully transitions.\n- The app works. (best one)\n"

You can now copy, paste, and shortcut at will!\n- Maximum width has been set on images, so now, Nimble won't resize as often. Plots will continue to resize Nimble, as they are not width variable.\n- A preferences/functions menu has been improved inside Nimble.\n  - You can now have Nimble read answers back to you, but this can sometimes be weird. Speech is experimental, and we hope to improve it in the future.\n  - You also now have the option to disable Math.js, the fastest way inside Nimble to do quick math like basic conversions and expressions. I don't know why you'd want to disable it, but hey, you can now.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>Size</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>Version</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>SHA256Sum</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <td>55.49MB</td>\n  <td>1.0.1</td>\n  <td>5370e7429f9dcc6dec5c2e84edfe19db010a686d571f4e28271e7e3a5f35ffb9</td>\n</table>\n"

      "body": "Hello! This is Ethan Arterberry, assistant developer and 1/3 of [Bright](http://madebybright.com/). We make apps. Up until recently when I was able to join the project Nimble was at slow pace due to the fact that not everyone has as much time on their hands as I do. The last project I worked on was called [EssayMaker](http://getessaymaker.com/), and it was huge. Once I was done with that, I asked if I could work with Josh and Adam on Nimble. They, being the infinitely caring and swamped with schoolwork folks they are, agreed. So here we are, version 1.0 of Nimble.\n\nWe thought this would take decades. Turns out, it took a slightly autistic 13 year old. Nonetheless, it's ready to use. Nimble is a menubar application personal assistant that's open source and free to use. It heavily relies on [Wolfram|Alpha®](http://www.wolframalpha.com/), a computational knowledge engine that we've had the utmost pain and pleasure of dealing with, as well as [math.js](http://mathjs.org/), which handles simple math instead of wasting bandwidth and time throwing it to Wolfram. Basically, it's the reason `1 + 1` doesn't take 10 seconds to come back. Nimble is also built on the horribly underdocumented and underused [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/), which allows us to keep everything cross-platform by using web technologies like [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [WebKit](https://webkit.org/). This also makes development easier for us as we are all web developers.\n\nNimble can do many things, for example:\n- tell you who won the last Blazers game (`who won the last Trail Blazers game?`)\n- tell you what \"yiff\" means (`define yiff`)\n- graph a picture of Donald Trump (`graph Donald Trump`)\n- give non-answers to your existential questions (`does God exist?`)\n- show the Home Alone 2 movie poster through a dog's eyes (`apply dog vision to the Home Alone 2 poster`)\n- answer your burning playground debates (`Did Han Solo shoot first?`)\n- even do your math homework! (`Solve 3x2 + x - 7 = 4x`)\n\n## How to use Nimble:\n1. Once you have Nimble running, just click the icon (looks like an equals sign) on your menubar (location varies based on OS) to start it up\n2. You can enter a query in the orange input and press `Enter` or click the search button to search for it\n3. The result will load, and when it's done you can right click on the result to get options based on it. (sharing, etc.) This will be improved upon in the near future.\n4. If you're tech saavy, you can open the Dev Tools by shift-clicking the Nimble menubar icon\n5. Finally, to close Nimble, right-click the Nimble icon\n\nThat's just the beginning of what Nimble can do! You'll just have to use it to find out! We're doing our best to test, optimize, and improve Nimble, but we're just 3 teenagers. If you'd like to help us out, you can do so by filing an issue on the GitHub repo (which you are currently visiting!) or contacting us via [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nimbledotapp). Either way, you can download it below for your platform of choice and tell us what you think.\n\nNimble will soon work on all platforms, but for now, we are starting on OS X.\n"
