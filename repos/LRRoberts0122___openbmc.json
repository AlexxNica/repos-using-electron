(#10)\n- Fixed an issue where you had to click the back button twice from the end of the path to go backwards. (#4)\n- Removed the active states from the sidebar menu. (#6)\n- Removed the copy button for the curl command. (#9)\n\n**Known Issues**\n- The title bar in the Windows application pushed down the OpenBMC logo so that it is obstructed by the login panel.\n"
