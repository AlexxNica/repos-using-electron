It would be awesome if anyone testing this release could keep a close eye open for any problems or issues with this and reports them so I can jump on them. If any serious issues crop up this release is backwards compatible with 2.0.1 so don't hesitate to downgrade\n\n### Here's the full list of what's new...\n- Better handling of lossy data returned from Google compared to 2.0.2\n- Fixes to unread count reporting higher number than actually unread\n- Fixes to unread count not reporting correctly for users with more than 100 unread messages\n- Fix notifications and unread counts not being retrieved when proxy settings are set\n- Atomically write databases protecting against instances where the os force quits\n- Added delete account button to settings\n- Added cmd+click for account icons\n- Added unread count in window titlebar\n- Fix missing `libtrayindicator1` dependency for ubuntu 16+\n- Option to disable smooth scrolling\n"

      "body": "This version contains a number of improvements over the previous release; in particular the code that communicates with Google fetching the unread counts and notifications has been overhauled to fix some bugs and quota problems. It would be awesome if anyone testing this release could keep a close eye open for any problems or issues with this and reports them so I can jump on them. If any serious issues crop up this release is backwards compatible with 2.0.1 so don't hesitate to downgrade\n\n### Here's the full list of what's new...\n- Fixes to unread count reporting higher number than actually unread\n- Fixes to unread count not reporting correctly for users with more than 100 unread messages\n- Fix notifications and unread counts not being retrieved when proxy settings are set\n- Atomically write databases protecting against instances where the os force quits\n- Added delete account button to settings\n- Added cmd+click for account icons\n- Added unread count in window titlebar\n- Fix missing `libtrayindicator1` dependency for ubuntu 16+\n- Option to disable smooth scrolling\n"

      "body": "**The mammoth release**. This release contains an amazing 212 commits over version 1.3.1 - almost doubling the total commit count. I think smaller releases are called for in the future!\n\nI'd like to send a giant thanks to everyone who's been testing the pre-release channel and reporting bugs. Without all your testing this release wouldn't have been possible!\n\n### Breaking change\n\nWindows uses upgrading from 1.3.6 earlier will need to uninstall WMail before upgrading. Not doing this will result in two WMail installs. [More information](https://github.com/Thomas101/wmail/wiki/Windows-users-upgrading-to-2.0.0)\n\n# Upgrades\n\nAll the core libraries WMail uses have been upgraded. These include..\n- Updated to chrome 53\n- Updated to electron 1.4.4\n- Updated to React 15.3.2\n\n# Keyboard Shortcuts\n- Added keyboard shortcuts for prev and next mailbox. `ctrl/cmd+<` and `ctrl/cmd+>`\n- Added navigate backwards and forwards shortcuts. `ctrl/cmd+[` and `ctrl/cmd+]`\n- Added `cmd+0` accelerator for resetting font size\n- Added the `cmd/ctrl+left` shortcut like Chrome\n\n# Context Menu\n- Context menu now has Paste and Match Style along with a link to the WMail settings\n- Added Copy Link Address to Context Menu\n\n# Tray\n- Tray icon designer in the settings screen\n- Better tray icon on Windows to improve legibility\n- Option to change the background colour of the tray icon\n- Auto-theming of tray depending on OS theme\n- Fixed tray icon needlessly redrawing updates when there were no updates to draw\n- DPI Multiplier for tray icon for users with 4K monitors\n- Changed Tray menu to have submenus for each mailbox\n\n# User Interface\n- Detecting when you launch WMail in an offline state and showing a splash screen rather than a broken WMail\n- Consistent Windows app icon (no more pixelation! Woo!)\n- Changed the layout of the settings screen to use the available screen space\n- Moved Google icon for users who have sidebar disabled and embedded titlebar \n- Removed excess top space from side-menu on linux, windows and when the toolbar is enabled\n- Added Restart button when you change a setting that requires an app restart\n- Added preview of hovered link address\n- Add option to set your own CSS and JavaScript on a per mailbox basis. So if you want everything red... you can have everything red 😀\n- Unread count over app icon for Ubuntu users using Unity\n- Better update dialog and a more robust backend so I can stage the releases\n- Update check always happens daily now. Option to disable this\n\n# Notifications\n- Focus WMail window when clicking on a notification\n- Focus WMail window when clicking on the tray notifications\n\n# Other Features\n- Support for 38+ dictionary languages! Bonjour, Hola, Hallo!\n- Added Mailbox Search\n- Added Primary Inbox support for GMail\n- Added option to remove custom account avatar\n- Option to open at startup on OS X & windows\n- Fixed incorrect unread count being shown in some circumstances\n- Option to persist cookies for accounts using SAML authentication & option to nuke data when cookies have expired\n- Added ignore-gpu-blacklist flag under advanced for linux users having rendering issues\n- Added --hidden command line switch so you can launch WMail in the background\n- Downloads now download to a temporary file before completion\n\n# Bugs\n- Fixed sidemenu toggle shortcut on windows & linux\n- Fixed window offsetting to left when switching mailbox\n- Fixed toolbar disappearing on windows & linux\n- Removed Open links in background for platforms that don’t support it\n- Disabled multiple-account menu items when there is only one account\n- Downloads now add the file extension even if the user omits it\n\n# Bundling\n- The packaging script now automatically creates the distribution files for each platform\n- Windows now has separate 32 and 64 bit builds\n- OSX has a brand new dmg rather than just zipping the folder up\n- Windows uses a non proprietary installer\n- Tar linux builds rather than zip for better compression\n- Deb packages for linux\n\n# Code\n- Code has been restructured into 3 main packages. The primary package, main app and mailboxes window. Because of this I've been able to remove a lot of dead code that was shipping in the production build. This has reduced file size and decreased build time. Here' some fancy stats\n  - Production filesize 17% smaller (164mb to 136mb)\n  - 95% reduction in files (9878 to 415)\n- Dependencies have been updated\n- Startup process looks a fair bit cleaner with UI placeholders\n- Moved the database from localstorage to a centralised app database\n  - This means data is available throughout the app and database duplication has been removed\n  - The main thread has direct access to the data and listens on changes directly\n  - The models are now common between the main and rendering thread for reduced code duplication\n- The kitchen sink has been taken out of `app.js` to make code more maintainable\n- Renamed Google Mailbox to WMail on Google Services\n- Split the GoogleMailbox view to use a common WebView that deals with the nasties of managing its state\n- Refactored the webview injection code to be more modular and extensible\n- Removed multiple instances of dom thrashing in the webview injection code. This should speed up start times\n"

Not doing this will result in two WMail installs\n\n# Changes\n\nHere's what's made it into the release...\n- Fixed file upload button styles\n- Added Latvian dictionary\n- Updated electron & React\n- Download notifications now open the file when selecting\n- Downloads now download to a temporary file before completion\n- Downloads now add the file extension even if the user omits it\n- Update check always happens daily now. Option to disable this\n- Make WMail respond to `--hidden` command whilst running\n- Refactored the webview injection code to be more modular and extensible\n- Removed multiple instances of dom thrashing in the webview injection code. This should speed up start times\n- Updated some deprecated electron functions\n- Changed Tray menu to have submenus for each mailbox\n- Tray icon now tries to detect OS theme\n- Update cookie persistence code to make it more efficient, thanks to some added electron features\n"

      "body": "This version forms _(hopefully)_ the final release candidate for version 1.4.0\n\n# Breaking changes\n- Users running **1.3.7** who changed their spellcheck language will lose this setting when upgrading, so you'll need to configure this again.\n- Windows uses upgrading from **1.3.6 earlier** will need to uninstall WMail before upgrading. Not doing this will result in two WMail installs\n\n# Updates\n- Replaced the JavaScript spell checker with prebuilt native versions of hunspell (hunspell is what chrome, firefox, openOffice etc uses). This makes everything better and has allowed me to add some extra features. These include:\n  - Reduced RAM and CPU usage\n  - Makes spellchecking much faster and spelling suggestions much much MUCH faster!\n  - Removes the need for WMail to listen on an incoming network port\n  - Fixes issues with some dictionaries (including Italian and Russian)\n  - Allows WMail to save downloaded dictionaries rather than throwing them away every time the dictionary is changed\n  - Allows WMail to use native context menus which means paste works across the app instead of in most places\n  - Allows WMail to support multiple dictionaries at once \n- Added `ignore-gpu-blacklist` flag under advanced for linux users having rendering issues\n- Added Restart button when you change a setting that requires an app restart\n- Disabled multiple-account menu items when there is only one account\n- Added preview of hovered link address\n- Add option to set your own CSS and JavaScript on a per mailbox basis. So if you want everything red... you can have everything red 😀 \n- Deb packages for linux\n- Unread count over app icon for Ubuntu users using Unity\n- DPI Multiplier for tray icon for users with 4K monitors\n- Added `--hidden` command line switch so you can launch WMail in the background\n\n_All this and it's not even 9am! Lets find breakfast! 🍳🍳🍳_\n"

Bonjour, Hola, Hallo!\n- Detecting when you launch WMail in an offline state and showing a splash screen rather than a broken WMail\n- Consistent Windows app icon (no more pixelation! Woo!)\n- Better tray icon on Windows to improve legibility\n- Option to change the background colour of the tray icon\n- Tray icon designer in the settings screen\n- Changed the layout of the settings screen to use the available screen space\n- Context menu now has `Paste and Match Style` along with a link to the WMail settings\n- Added the Cmd/Ctrl+Left shortcut like Chrome\n- Better update dialog and a more robust backend so I can stage the releases\n\n# Fixes & Code\n- Updated electron and some other libs\n- Fixed the zoom level being reset when typing/navigating\n- Fixed window management keyboard shortcuts on Linux and Windows\n- Hopefully a better fix for the window offset and cut off\n\n# Bundling\n- The packaging script now automatically creates the distribution files for each platform\n- Windows now has separate 32 and 64 bit builds\n- OSX has a brand new dmg rather than just zipping the folder up\n- Windows uses a non proprietary installer\n- Tar linux builds rather than zip for better compression\n  - _On a side note to this, I was hoping to make deb and snap builds for linux. If anyone has any expertise in this area it would be great to work together on this - my linux-foo is weak_\n"

      "body": "This release feels like it's been the hardest and most difficult one to put together but it's finally here! Time to enjoy some sunshine ☀️☀️☀️. The release originally focused on code improvement and filesize reduction to save my sanity when doing windows builds, but a few great features and bug fixes have snuck in!\n\n# Features\n- Added keyboard shortcuts for prev and next mailbox. `ctrl/cmd+<` and `ctrl/cmd+>`\n- Added navigate backwards and forwards shortcuts. `ctrl/cmd+[` and `ctrl/cmd+]`\n- Added Mailbox Search usable via `ctrl/cmd+F and ctrl/cmd+G'\n- Added Primary Inbox support for GMail\n\n# Bugs\n- Removed excess top space from side-menu on linux, windows and when the toolbar is enabled\n- Focus WMail window when clicking on a notification\n- Focus WMail window when clicking on the tray notifications\n- Fixed context menu on linux\n- Fixed incorrect unread count being shown in some circumstances\n\n# Code\n- Code has been restructured into 3 main packages. The primary package, main app and mailboxes window. Because of this I've been able to remove a lot of dead code that was shipping in the production build. This has reduced file size and decreased build time. Here' some fancy stats\n  - Production filesize 17% smaller (164mb to 136mb)\n  - 95% reduction in files (9878 to 415)\n- Dependencies have been updated\n- Electron has been updated to version 1.2 which had a few breaking changes\n- Startup process looks a fair bit cleaner with UI placeholders\n- Moved the database from localstorage to a centralised app database\n  - This means data is available throughout the app and database duplication has been removed\n  - The main thread has direct access to the data and listens on changes directly\n  - The models are now common between the main and rendering thread for reduced code duplication\n- The kitchen sink has been taken out of `app.js` to make code more maintable\n- Renamed Google Mailbox to WMail on Google Services\n- Split the GoogleMailbox view to use a common WebView that deals with the nasties of managing its state\n- Changed to use typo.js spellchecker as nodehun has been discontinued. Had to patch the library (submitted PR) and place in an separate thread. This also resulted in the context menu needing to be written in JavaScript rather than using the native menu. Why is finding a good spell checker so hard?!?\n"
