It is added for them.\n- added Silk global.  It stores various information on parts of the Core so the server api can use it.\n- added server api.  It is available in apps as Silk.api.  It is used similar to methods on client.  It currently has methods to restart and start apps and get a list of installed apps.\n- moved methods global in apps to Silk.methods.  It is backwards compatible for now.\n- ws is now at localhost:3000/websocket instead of on it's own port\n- Silk url is shown in a box\n\nWindow Manager\n- Moved from core to folder `window-manager`\n- Added app menu\n- Improved style of task bar and windows\n- Apps can have multiple windows.  They need to enable it in their window.json\n- added tooltips for apps on taskbar with their title.\n\nRemote\nremote is partially fixed. It now loads icons and apps, but web sockets don't work yet.\n\nApps\n- app defaults\n  - if the settings file doesn't exist, it creates it.\n- added App Manager\n  - installs and removes apps.  It starts an app after installing it.\n- file explorer\n  - creates folders\n  - changed color of logo\n  - supports multiple windows\n- added task manager\n  - restart running apps\n- added terminal.
