However these comments came with complexity. For rapid use the tool \"Comment\" was made. Early version was in `vala`, then in `C#` + `Kary Framework` and then the `Swift` +`Cocoa` [GUI](https://github.com/pmkary/comment). However this very latest version of Comment with is **Comment IV** has been developed with web technologies and some native OS integrations so that it's for the first time cross-platform and comes with the latest Kary Foundation UI System designed carefully to be classy while it is effective.\n\nThis new version of comment also comes with a more complete collection of the comments used within the Kary Foundation. We are working to bring you the whole KF comment style.\n"
